This engineering thesis project presents the design and implementation of a tool for procedural terrain generation based on heightmaps. The tool enables the creation of realistic 3D landscapes using a combination of algorithms, including Perlin noise, Diamond-Square, and hydraulic erosion. These methods allow for the generation of natural-looking terrains by simulating both the initial shape and the effects of long-term geological processes. The application provides users with control over terrain parameters and offers real-time visualization, making it suitable for use in simulations, games, and other virtual environments.
